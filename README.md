# Try harder, STM

Montreal's transit system is among the best in North America, but parts of the still are still desperately lacking service. We collected nearly 500M of data and calculated which areas of Montreal need help the most.

Right now the code is specifically tailored towards the STM and the island of Montreal. But the **dev** branch (WIP) is a refactor to the code to make it usable to anyone with the right datasets and a valid google API key. They would download the repo and use main.py to run the code.
