Goal: For all the Boroughs in the Island of Montreal, find the average walking time of citizens to get to the closest bus stop.

Right now the code is specifically tailored towards the STM and the island of Montreal. But the **dev** branch (WIP) is a refactor to the code to make it usable to anyone with the right datasets and a valid google API key. They would download the repo and use main.py to run the code.
