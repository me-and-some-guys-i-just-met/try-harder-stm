this guide assumes that you have cloned the repository and have access to write here (which you have done and do!)

### add your files

`git add <filename>`

### commit your changes

`git commit`

you will be dropped into your text editor of choice and now you write a commit message, save, and quit.

### push your changes

`git push`

if it tells you "upstream is ahead" or something, then you will need to first `git pull` to bring the remote changes to your machine. if the changes conflict with yours, you might also have to merge them.
